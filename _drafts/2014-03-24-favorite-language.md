Recently I've been porting a few of my apps to [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit), the greatest language I've ever worked with. I originally used [AppJS](https://github.com/appjs/appjs) for my Kickstarter project YouParty. AppJS has since been abandoned and while looking for a replacement I found node-webkit. 

node-webkit is [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) on the backend, and html/javascript running in a [chromium](http://www.chromium.org/) build on the front end. This allows you to use the thousands of node.js modules, javascript libraries, and html/css frameworks to make desktop applications. The possibilities are endless.
