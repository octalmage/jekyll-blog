Recently I came across [this](http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2013/04/26/fragment-caching-in-wordpress/) bit of code that allows you to cache rendered HTML that may require PHP and MySQL to generate. I've used simular methods before, like caching slow queries, or building bits of html and storing them in cache, but using a buffer like this is awesome.
