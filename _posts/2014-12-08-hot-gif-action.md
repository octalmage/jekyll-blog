title: HOT GIF ACTION
---

We use HipChat at work, and I wanted a way to quickly spam my coworkers with gifs. I found giphy.com and they had an easy to use API, so I created Hot Gifs. 

[https://github.com/octalmage/hotgifs](https://github.com/octalmage/hotgifs)

With Hot Gifs running, you press Cmd+Alt+G and a window pops up, you type a word or phrase, hit enter then it copies a related gif url to your clipboard. The results are hilarious.
