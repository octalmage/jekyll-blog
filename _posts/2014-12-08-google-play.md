title: "Last.fm/iOS Hacking"
---

I completely forgot about Last.fm. I have around 5 years of music logged and I'd like to continue using it. Recently I've been using Google Music for music, so I've got to scrobble from there. 

I found a Chrome plugin that scrobbles using the Google Music website, but I listen to most of my music using the iOS app. 

I'm going to write a mobile substrate plugin to hook Google Music and detect when songs start playing. I've got a class-dump, time to start experimenting!
