title: "WordPress for user management."
---

Recently I needed to quickly add user management to an application and to me, WordPress was the obvious choice. It has everything I need, registration, profile management, password recovery, roles and more! 

Integration took less than an hour. I created a login page using WordPress, then included the WordPress API in the application to get information about the logged in user. It worked out perfectly!
